## Results Summary
This project demonstrates statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis
using a clinical heart disease dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding
relationships between serum cholesterol and key clinical variables such as age,
resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate. Linear regression models,
model comparison, and stratified visualizations were used to evaluate variable
importance and interpret patterns across patient subgroups.
